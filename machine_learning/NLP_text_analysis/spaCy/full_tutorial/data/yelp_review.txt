SO cute/pretty inside, can't wait to see this place in the summer with the doors all open. Parking nearby is easy and $5 for 2 hours. Went on a Saturday for brunch with a reservation which they promptly sat us for. Great, friendly server who offered suggestions and was personable. Can order off the brunch menu or regular one which makes me VERY happy since I don't like how most brunch menus are small, even though theirs is not.

Ordered cocktails-
Bloody Mary was good, the rim gives it some spice
Cherry mule-good, just a little sweet for my liking.

Ordered food-
The blueberry muffin skillet which was 10/10, definitely order it for the table!
Chicken & waffles- so good, especially the funnel cake waffle
Cuban-beautiful and delicious
Crab cake Benny- delicious but only one in the order with a little salad.

Will 100% be back and can't wait to try more things on the menu. Only downside is it is a little pricey but that's about it.
