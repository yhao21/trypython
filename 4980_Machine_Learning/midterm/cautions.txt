1. No data in deeplink
				sometimes website does not have detail info for particular coin,
				if that happend,
								1. use try-except to skip
								2. add error info to a dataframe
								3. print and save dataframe to a csv file. Help user to check and re download.
												dataframe should contain the following info:
																1. deeplink url
																2. coin name(should be the file name, so that you can remove the
																existing html file when you re-download)
								4. Name of dataframe:
												[Error Log]
2. parsing deeplink:
				you must run 'parsing_coin_deeplink' first, then gecko's, because coin's function can
				initialize 'Error_Log.csv'
