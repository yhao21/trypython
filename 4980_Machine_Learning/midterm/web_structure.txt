Questions
===============

1. How attributes affects change of SIMETRI score?


2. Different among two website
				which web's data are more flucuated?



===============
Big idea for question 1
===============
1. Get the deeplink of each coin and parse SIMETRI score


2. Data Summary
				variables:
								price
								24h Volume
								mktcap

				attributes of variables:
								max
								min
								quantile
								mean
								std deviation



3. Regression 							---->  Use logistic machine
				Y = SIMETRI score				    ----> trans A, B, C to 1, 2, 3 for analysis convenience. 
				X1 = price std deviation
				X2 = 24h Vol std deviation
				X3 = MKTcap std deviation				----> how mktcap fluctuation affect score
				X4 = price mean							----> does higher price leads to higher score
				X5 = 24h Vol mean
				X6 = MKTcap mean

				Consider std deviation as the fluctuation
				If change aggressive, VAR big



===============
Question 2
===============
1. have all coin's 48 hrs data

2. compute std deviation for each variable, i.e., price, volume, mktcap
				Then you will have data like this:

				coin			coinmktcap std				gecko std
				bitcon			3.23								3.12
				ETH					2.32								5.233

3. compare which have more std. Note, have to set a criterion, how much different should be defined as different std deviation.
				i.e., if 3.23 vs 3.233, we say they are same
				      if 3.23 vs 5.23,  we say one is more fluctuated than the other.




===============
Method
===============

1. download top 500 cryptocoin from homepage

2. at last, get deeplink of each coin.


Notice, for those at margin, you should be really carefull. they may not in the data all the time, i.e., BTC is rank 500 today,
but rank 510 tomorrow. Then, it will not have a 48 hrs data.

				To avoid, use coin only iff they have 192 repetition (48hrs)
